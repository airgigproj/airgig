Sortable Lists Using jQuery UI
jQuery



Unordered lists have a number of useful applications.  They are commonly used to structure a site’s navigation.  I have found, in a number of web applications, that the ability to reorder (sort) such lists would be extremely useful.  So, how can this be achieved?

I’m a big fan of the jQuery library.  Since most of the applications I build use jQuery, developing with this library would be the most logical approach.  But wait…  It looks like there are 2 jQuery plugins that allow elements to be sorted.  These are the jQuery Interface plugin and jQuery UI.

At first, I started working with “Interface”.  I soon ran into problems as I started working with styled lists.  For some reason, the list elements lost their styling as they were being dragged.  I just couldn’t quite put my finger on the problem - perhaps I missed something.  I then started working with jQuery UI.  This plugin retained the styling - perfect!

However, neither of these plugins provide a method to easily save and reload the list element order.  Hence, should a user change the order of the list, these changes would be lost as the page is refreshed.



Saving the Reordered List

I determined that the easiest way to accomplish this is through the use of a cookie.  The jQuery UI plugin already allows you to send the ID’s of the list elements (in order) to an array.  Using Klaus Hart’s Cookie plugin, we can easily save the list element order to a cookie.  But how do we retain/reload the element order saved to the cookie?

To restore the element order, I decided to remove all the sortable list elements from the DOM and then immediately append them to their parent element (in the order sepcified by the cookie).  This is all done after the document has loaded.

The HTML Markup

<ul id="list1">
<li id="item-1">List Item 1</li>
<li id="item-2">List Item 2</li>
<li id="item-3">List Item 3</li>
<li id="item-4">List Item 4</li>
<li id="item-5">List Item 5</li>
<li id="item-6">List Item 6</li>
</ul>
The Javascript

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
/////  EDIT THE FOLLOWING VARIABLE VALUES  //////////////////////
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 
// set the list selector
var setSelector = "#list1";
// set the cookie name
var setCookieName = "listOrder";
// set the cookie expiry time (days):
var setCookieExpiry = 7;
 
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
/////  YOU PROBABLY WON'T NEED TO EDIT BELOW  ///////////////////
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 
// function that writes the list order to a cookie
function getOrder() {
	// save custom order to cookie
	$.cookie(setCookieName, $(setSelector).sortable("toArray"), { expires: setCookieExpiry, path: "/" });
}
 
// function that restores the list order from a cookie
function restoreOrder() {
	var list = $(setSelector);
	if (list == null) return
 
	// fetch the cookie value (saved order)
	var cookie = $.cookie(setCookieName);
	if (!cookie) return;
 
	// make array from saved order
	var IDs = cookie.split(",");
 
	// fetch current order
	var items = list.sortable("toArray");
 
	// make array from current order
	var rebuild = new Array();
	for ( var v=0, len=items.length; v<len;>
		rebuild[items[v]] = items[v];
	}
 
	for (var i = 0, n = IDs.length; i &lt; n; i++) {
 
		// item id from saved order
		var itemID = IDs[i];
 
		if (itemID in rebuild) {
 
			// select item id from current order
			var item = rebuild[itemID];
 
			// select the item according to current order
			var child = $("ul.ui-sortable").children("#" + item);
 
			// select the item according to the saved order
			var savedOrd = $("ul.ui-sortable").children("#" + itemID);
 
			// remove all the items
			child.remove();
 
			// add the items in turn according to saved order
			// we need to filter here since the "ui-sortable"
			// class is applied to all ul elements and we
			// only want the very first!  You can modify this
			// to support multiple lists - not tested!
			$("ul.ui-sortable").filter(":first").append(savedOrd);
		}
	}
}
 
// code executed when the document loads
$(function() {
	// here, we allow the user to sort the items
	$(setSelector).sortable({
		axis: "y",
		cursor: "move",
		update: function() { getOrder(); }
	});
 
	// here, we reload the saved order
	restoreOrder();
});
There are 2 functions to be concerned with in the above code.  The first, “getOrder()”, writes the order of the list elements to a cookie.  The second, “restoreOrder()”, fetches the order saved to the cookie and restores that order.  We execute “getOrder()” each time the list order is changed.  We execute “restoreOrder()” after the document has loaded.

Using the code provided above, you should only need to change the variables (at the very top) to get this working with your page.  Just remember to include the jQuery library and jQuery UI plugin!  I hope this is helpful!

Pretty good script. Just one suggestion.
If you want your to contain more than just text you’ll have to set savedOrd to something like this:
var savedOrd = “” + $(’#’ + itemID).html() + “”;
There is probably a more elegant solution to this (so we don’t have to build the tag ourselves). I’m hoping someone replies with the answer. I’m guessing .children() has an issue when the child has children. This is a legacy function anyways (http://docs.jquery.com/API/1.1.1/DOM/Traversing).

jQuery UI does allow you to connect 2 lists - so it certainly is possible. However, I would need to rework some of the code.

Thanks. To clarify — I’m trying to sort 2 columns separately. Items from Column 1 don’t need to mix with Column 2 items. Is it an easier to use this script with 2 separate columns?
Appreciate the help. New to JS and have been working hours on this one.

The code would still need to be reworked due to the selectors used. jQuery UI adds the “ui-sortable” class to each list. In the code, we select this class:
$("ul.ui-sortable")
If there are 2 lists, the function will select both lists instead of working with each list separately. To get this working, you would probably need to pass the selector as a parameter of the function.
You would also need to write something like this for each list:
$(setSelector).sortable({
	axis: "y",
	cursor: "move",
	update: function() { getOrder(); }
});

That was it! The code needed to know which ID to update. In the FOR loop, I changed 3 references to $(”ul.ui-sortable”) to $(”ul” + setSelector + “.ui-sortable”).
Not sure if this abstracts well, but the 2 columns are now sorting and remembering correctly. Appreciate the help.

Can this be used outside of a list? In my particular case, I’ve got
…stuff…
…stuff…
…stuff…
…stuff…
I know when I put it that way, it looks like it should be a list, but each .module holds a table and it’s really a bit much for a UL… and there may be constraints on the current structure I’m not aware of. Anyways, what I want is to order the .module divs.

jQuery UI does allow you to connect several unordered lists (http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Sortables). However, I don’t think that this code is capable of inserting each list item in the order stored in the cookie. It will of course be possible to do this. However, I fear that my JavaScript knowledge will let me down.

What should I do so it work with div too? I don’t really understand javascript …

Great tutorial!! Thanks a lot.
I managed to use the tutorial to create a page with 3 columns (with divs). And cookies are storing the data within the each column however if I move the divs from one column to another cookies don’t work!!
It looks like it doesn’t update the list properly…
ANY IDEAS?
(I’ve changed the code a bit and add up JimC’s solution. I can post it if you like or e-mail….)

Hi, I wonder how to add a function delete the cookie which you have save on this page.
I tried this, but it wont work,

Really nice plugin, but how do i actually retrieve the values from the cookie and store them into a sql server database?
I want users to change the order of a menu, f.e:
Menuitem 1
Menuitem 2
Menuitem 3
Menuitem 4
Each Menuitem has a record in the db and an unique ID.
Each Menuitem has a field called “Order” in the database.
How do i read the cookie, split the values and store them into the right record into the “Order” field?
So: update menutable set order = where menuID = .
Is that possible?
Thanks in advance.

I came across this problem when i was working with another javascript sortables plugin, in the end it was because i was hanging hooks on the id’s of the draggable items.
It’s confusing but i think it goes like this: as soon as you pick up a draggable item it’s not really picking it up it’s creating a cuplicate, this duplicate doesnt have the id of the original so the stylings drop. I go around this by hanging my styles on class names instead.
I guess jquery ui has some crafty code in to get around this problem.

Hello,
I am A developer and i used yours Sortable plug-in. It was working fine. But My boss demanded to float the divs with different width and height and then apply ui.sortable to them.
He also said me to make it like google when on just on the touch to other div border, sorting starts.
But when i made the divs float with different sizes, and applied sortable on them. We noticed that we had to move any box all over the other box in order to sort them. Sometimes it becomes very difficult to sort the boxes from left to right.
My Questions are:
1: How can i make two widgets or boxes sortable by keeping them as float just on touching the boundaries of the each from left, right, bottom or top? Means to say, instead of entirely overlapping each other widget, the widgets must swap or sorted just on a little contact from any direction by keeping their floating position intact.
2: How can i attach the place-holder and apply forceplaceholder property with floating widgets or divs?
Please reply me asap.
Regards
Murtaza

FWIW the following restoreOrder function works for me (jquery 1.6):
function restoreOrder() {
var i, old_order, cookie = $.cookie(setCookieName);
if (!cookie) { return; }
old_order = cookie.split(”,”);
for (i = 0; i < old_order.length; i++) {
$(’#'+old_order[i]).appendTo($(setSelector));
}
}

Wow, thanks! This works just great, I have used it on my front page of my web site, and it works a treat across all browsers. Its working with jQuery 1.4.2, I didnt need to modify anything. The only extra was to download the jQuery Cookie plugin as well.
